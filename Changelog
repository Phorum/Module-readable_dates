Changelog for @PACKAGE@
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2011-01-09 v1.1.11

    - Added new German language files. Thanks to Oliver Riesen!

2010-04-26 v1.1.10

    - The original dates are now available as $data['orig_<datefield>'], so
		  they can still be accessed when needed from the templates.

2009-08-26 v1.1.9

    - Added support for the Russian language. Also added a Russian language
      file. Thanks to phorum.org user sailord for the translation!

    - Added a Spanish translation. Thanks to Chris Brown!

    - Added a French translation. Thanks to phorum.org user manuvb!

2008-12-14 v1.1.8

    - Fixed a typo that caused "date_last_active" for the user profile
      screen to never be formatted by this module.

2008-07-25 v1.1.7

    - Added a switch in the module config to enable/disable the formatting
      of the user registration date on the read pages (Registered: ... ago).
      If this switch is enabled, then dates after the configured time
      limit will be formatted using a standard short date. This is different
      from Phorum's default behavior, because by default Phorum would
      use a readable date-like formatting for this date already.

2008-05-28 v1.1.6

    - Another undefined index warning fixed and again it was CBiLL
      who was kind enough to be the lab rat.

2008-03-26 v1.1.5

    - Some more undefined index warnings fixed. These would occur if user
      activity tracking is disabled or if the user hides its activity
      through the privacy settings. Thanks to CBiLL for the report!

    - A configuration option was added to make it possible to disable
      the readable numbers (one, two, three instead of 1, 2, 3).

2008-03-11 v1.1.4

    - Fixes for some undefined index warnings in readable_dates.php.
      Thanks to CBiLL for the heads up!

2008-03-03 v1.1.3

    - Added support for formatting dates in the private message and buddy
      interfaces (pm list, pm read, buddy list). These features need Phorum
      version 5.2.7 or higher (the admin interface will warn about this if
      an older version of Phorum is used).

2008-03-02 v1.1.2

    - Added an option to specify the maximum time for which a date
      should be formatted by this module. Dates that are older will be
      displayed using their original formatting. Thanks to CBiLL for
      the feature suggestion.

    - Fixed a bug, which resulted in empty dates being formatted as
      if the date was Januari 1st, 1970 (Epoch zero). Thanks to
      CBiLL for the bug report.

2008-03-01 v1.1.1

    - Added a better German translation to the package. Thanks to Thomas
      for fixing my crappy German translation!

    - Fixed the formatting code to make sure that it will work
      correctly in localized environments.

2008-03-01 v1.1.0

    - Rewrote the module to be compatible with 5.2 and to make full
      use of new Phorum features.

2006-05-08 v1.0.7

    - Fixed typo: "Las edit was" -> "Last edit was" (thanks CBiLL).

2006-03-28 v1.0.6

    - Do a restore for time formats at the end of the list and the
      read hook, as suggested by Oliver Riesen. This will take away
      some problems with other modules that are using time formatting
      as well (but probably not all of them, in case date formatting
      is run before the list/read hooks).

2006-03-01 v1.0.5

    - The script did not load the right defaults.php file.

    - Even more fixes for TZ handling. Users that have a timezone
      set in the control center should now get a correct 
      date too when using this mod.

2006-01-20 v1.0.4

    - Some more fixes for correct TZ handling. The previous version was
      trying to fix problems in the wrong place, which caused unexpected
      side-effect problems.

    - The dates on the read page can now be formatted as well.

    - A settings screen has been added. In the settings you can configure
      on which pages you want to apply the readable date formatting.

2006-01-19 v1.0.3

    - Some fixes for correct TZ handling (as suggested by regdos)

2006-01-17 v1.0.2

    - wrong datafield used for lastpost formatting (reported by regdos)

2006-01-16 v1.0.1

    - Minor fix in French and German language packages

2006-01-10 v1.0.0

    - Initial release
